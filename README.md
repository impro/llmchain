# LLMChain
This is a quick-and-dirty port of [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to the Kotlin/JVM ecosystem.
Please note that this project is currently in the proof-of-concept stage,
and its API is subject to change.

## Quickstart
Have a look at the almost one-to-one translation of  [langchain Quickstart Guide](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html)
 in [Quickstart.kt](https://github.com/wangmuy/llmchain/blob/main/core/src/test/kotlin/com/wangmuy/llmchain/Quickstart.kt)
